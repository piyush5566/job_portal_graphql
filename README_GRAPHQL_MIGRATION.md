# GraphQL Migration

## Overview
This document describes the migration from REST API calls to GraphQL in the Job Portal application. The migration involved replacing direct database queries and operations with GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Changes Made

### Jobs Routes
1. `jobs_list` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `jobs` query
2. `job_detail` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `job` query
3. `apply_job` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `createApplication` mutation

### Job Seeker Routes
1. `my_applications` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `myApplications` query

### Employer Routes
1. `new_job` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `createJob` mutation
2. `my_jobs` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `user` query and accessing the `jobsPosted` field
3. `job_applications` route: Replaced direct database queries with GraphQL `job` query and `jobApplications` query
4. `delete_job` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `deleteJob` mutation
5. `update_application` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `updateApplicationStatus` mutation

### Auth Routes
1. `register` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `createUser` mutation
2. `login` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `users` query and filtering in Python
3. `profile` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `user` query and `updateUser` mutation

### Main Routes
1. `index` route: Replaced direct database queries with GraphQL `jobs` query and sorting/filtering in Python

### Admin Routes
1. `admin_users` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `users` query
2. `admin_new_user` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `createUser` mutation
3. `admin_edit_user` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `updateUser` mutation
4. `admin_delete_user` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `deleteUser` mutation
5. `admin_jobs` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `jobs` query
6. `admin_create_job` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `createJob` mutation
7. `admin_edit_job` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `updateJob` mutation
8. `admin_delete_job` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `deleteJob` mutation
9. `admin_applications` route: Replaced direct database query with GraphQL `applications` query
10. `admin_update_application` route: Replaced direct database operations with GraphQL `updateApplicationStatus` mutation

## Benefits of Using GraphQL

1. **Reduced Database Queries**: By using GraphQL, we can fetch exactly the data we need in a single request, reducing the number of database queries.

2. **Consistent API**: GraphQL provides a consistent API for all data operations, making the code more maintainable.

3. **Type Safety**: GraphQL's schema provides type safety, making it easier to catch errors at compile time.

4. **Flexibility**: GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

5. **Improved Performance**: By reducing the number of requests and the amount of data transferred, GraphQL can improve application performance.

## Implementation Details

The migration involved:

1. Identifying REST API calls in the codebase
2. Examining the GraphQL schema and resolvers to understand what functionality is available
3. Replacing REST API calls with GraphQL calls
4. Testing the changes to ensure functionality is preserved

The implementation approach was to directly use the GraphQL resolvers in the route handlers, rather than making HTTP requests to the GraphQL endpoint. This approach is more efficient since it avoids the overhead of an HTTP request.

## Future Work

1. Continue migrating more REST API calls to GraphQL
2. Add more GraphQL queries and mutations to cover additional functionality
3. Implement client-side GraphQL using a library like Apollo Client
4. Add more complex GraphQL features like pagination, filtering, and sorting
